# DS701: Tools for Data Science - Education Chatbot

## Overview

This repository contains an LLM-based chatbot designed for the [DS701: Tools for Data Science](https://tools4ds.github.io/fa2024/) course at Boston University. The chatbot serves as an interactive learning assistant, helping students with course-related queries, explanations of concepts, and guidance on data science tools. It is powered by [edubotics-core](https://github.com/edubotics-ai/edubotics-core) a package of modules for data loading, vector store creation and management.

The chatbot will be available on HuggingFace Spaces soon. Lecture slides are available [here](https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/).

## Features

- 24/7 availability for student queries
- Explanations of key data science concepts
- Guidance on using data science tools and libraries
- Practice problem suggestions and explanations
- Course syllabus and schedule information
